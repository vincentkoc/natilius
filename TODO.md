# Natilius Modernization Roadmap ðŸš€

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive modernization plan for Natilius, structured in progressive phases to transform it into a modern, extensible, and maintainable developer environment setup tool.

## Current State Analysis
- **Architecture**: Monolithic bash scripts with basic modularity
- **Testing**: BATS-based tests with limited coverage
- **CI/CD**: Basic GitHub Actions workflow
- **Configuration**: Single `.natiliusrc` file with hardcoded values
- **Documentation**: README-focused with no API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Basic trap-based error handling
- **Logging**: File-based logging with timestamps

- All new features should include tests
- Breaking changes should be avoided or properly versioned
- Community feedback should drive prioritization
- Security should be considered in all implementations
- Performance impact should be measured for all changes

## Getting Started

1. Review and prioritize items based on community needs
2. Create GitHub issues for each task
3. Set up project board for tracking progress
4. Recruit contributors for specific phases
5. Establish regular progress reviews
